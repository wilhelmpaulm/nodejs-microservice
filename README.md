# nodejs-microservice

## what?
- Sample microservice built with nodejs and express

## why?
- a refresher for building an API in node.js
- a reference template for a future mini microservice
- a chill break

## who?
- @wilhelmpaulm
- a software engineer who constantly had to do multiple switches context for multiple teams with different tech stacks inside a week.
- a dev that's developed a bunch of stuff but still hasn't deeply mastered one tech stack (which he think is the cause of his impostor syndrome).
